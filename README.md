# BoruvkaMST

This repository is a place for us to work together while doing a school assignment for a parallel computing class given by the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences.

For our assignment we chose to work with the Boruvka Algorithm and build a multi-threaded solution for this algorithm.

## Copyright

Our solution is based on the serial algorithm written by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne. Their serial version can be found in this [repository](https://github.com/kevin-wayne/algs4).
